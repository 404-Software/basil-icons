# ðŸŽ¨ React Native Basil Icons

```ts
import { Twitch } from '@404-software/basil-icons/solid'

export const Icon = () => <Twitch />
```

## Credits

This package is a fork of [`react-native-iconic` by Fernando Rojo](https://github.com/nandorojo/react-native-iconic).

## Overview

- ðŸ˜Ž Free, beautiful icons
- ðŸ”¥ Customizable with `react-native-svg` props
- ðŸŒ² Tree-shaken components
- ðŸ¤– TypeScript support
- ðŸ“ˆ JS-only (+ works with Expo)

## Installation

```sh
yarn add @404-software/basil-icons react-native-svg
```

## Usage

Each icon is exported as its own component with an adjusted name.

For example, to use the `twitch` solid variant icon, import `Twitch` from `/solid`:

```tsx
import { Twitch } from '@404-software/basil-icons/solid'
```

You can also `import * as BasilIconsSolid`:

```tsx
import * as BasilIconsSolid from '@404-software/basil-icons/solid'

export const Icon = () => <BasilIconsSolid.Twitch />
```

For a full directory of components, see the [Craftwork](https://craftwork.design/downloads/basil) website.

### Custom color

```tsx
<Twitch color="black" />
```

### Custom size

```tsx
<Twitch height={30} width={30} />
```

## Props

Each icon component accepts all the props from `react-native-svg`'s `Svg` component. Reference [their docs](https://github.com/react-native-svg/react-native-svg#svg).

## How it works

This library uses `react-native-svg`. The components are generated by `svgr`. I downloaded all the free icons from [craftwork.design](https://craftwork.design/downloads/basil) and [ran a script](/generate/index.ts) to codegen the files from there.
